这是一个自己学习python爬虫的源代码项目
项目中的代码基本都来自一本叫做《用Python写网络爬虫》的书
其中代码总是零散的片段所以自己就花时间把代码整理了下，以后也会一点一点整理
英语不好所以就用中文来做标注

如果有喜欢源代码的可以点个星星，也希望大家能给我这个爬虫小白提意见

This is a source code project for yourself learning python reptiles
The code in the project comes basically from a book called "web Scraping with Python"
Which code is always fragmented so it took time to sort out the code, the next will be a little bit of finishing
English is not so good to use Chinese to do annotation

If you like the source code can point a star, but also hope that we can give me this reptile white comments
